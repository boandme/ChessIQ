# ♟️ ChessIQ

ChessIQ is a positional training tool designed for intermediate and advanced chess players who want to improve their ability to visualize, evaluate, and understand chess positions beyond tactics.

Instead of finding a forced move like in traditional tactical puzzles, ChessIQ challenges players to judge the position itself using strategic concepts such as material balance, space, initiative, king safety, and piece activity.

Think of ChessIQ as tactical puzzles for positional thinking.

**Status:** 🚧 Currently in beta, with active development leading up to v1.0.
