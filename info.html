    <h2>General Information</h2>
    <p>
      ChessIQ is a positional training tool for intermediate and above chess players that tests your ability to visualize and evaluate positions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players are given a position and must analyze it, either by simple material, space, or other positional concepts. It’s like tactical puzzles, but it trains your positional play to be very useful in real games!
    </p>
    <p>
      Although ChessIQ is in the beta stage right now, many more updates are coming soon, leading up to v1.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      ChessIQ’s main product is the <strong>Position Guessing Tool</strong>, but additional features such as AI opponents to play against are also coming soon.
